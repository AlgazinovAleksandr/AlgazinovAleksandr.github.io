Currently I'm an ML-Researcher and a Computer Science graduate student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/About/General_Information.htm), doing research under the supervision of [THUIAR](https://thuiar.github.io/) and [THUNLP](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) labs. My research interests are NLP, Multimodal AI, Multi-Agent Systems, Generative AI, and Time Series Analysis. 

Before coming to China, I studied Economics at [HSE University](https://www.hse.ru/en/), which is the best university in Russia for Computer Science and Economics. Already at the beginning of my studies, I became interested in Machine Learning. Hence, besides my main course work, I took many courses from the Department of Computer Science, such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Big Data, etc.

In addition to studying, I always wanted to apply my knowledge to real-world problems. Therefore, while studying, I worked as a Data Scientist at two largest banks in Russia (Sberbank and VTB Bank) for 2.5 years, which made a high-skilled and high-experienced specialist in the AI-domain.
